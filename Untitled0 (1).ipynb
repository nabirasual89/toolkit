        " - The pairplot() function in the Seaborn library serves to visualize relationships between multiple pairs of variables in a dataset. It generates a matrix of subplots, where each subplot displays the relationship between two different variables. The diagonal subplots typically show the distribution of a single variable, while the off-diagonal subplots show the relationship between two variables. This function is particularly useful in exploratory data analysis (EDA) for understanding the overall structure and potential relationships within a dataset. It helps identify patterns, trends, and correlations between variables, aiding in feature selection and model building."

        " - The pivot table in Pandas serves to reshape and aggregate data within a DataFrame. It restructures data by converting unique values from one or more columns into new columns, while simultaneously allowing for aggregation of other columns. This functionality enables users to summarize and analyze data from different perspectives, making it easier to identify patterns and relationships.\n",

        "21. Why is NumPy's array slicing faster than Python's list slicing?\n",
        " - NumPy's array slicing is faster than Python's list slicing due to how data is stored and processed. NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type contiguously in memory, allowing for efficient access and manipulation through optimized C code. When slicing, NumPy creates a view of the original array, avoiding unnecessary data copying. In contrast, Python lists store elements as pointers to objects scattered in memory, requiring more overhead for access and manipulation. Slicing a Python list creates a new list object, involving data copying. This difference in memory layout and handling, along with the use of optimized C code in NumPy, results in significantly faster slicing operations compared to Python lists."
